## java-design-patterns

Cookbook of commonly used Java design patterns based on examples from: 

* "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" - Gamma et al
* "Head First Design Patterns" - Freeman et al
* "Java Design Patterns" - Tony Brevis

I'll be adding new patterns to the project on an ad-hoc basis; I have beer to drink and a day job buried in WebRTC ;-)

Each pattern is contained in its own package - the package-info will provide more details and the Test class 
will demonstrate how to use it. Check the javadoc folder too.

Any comments/bugs/better ways of doing things, send 'em my way!
